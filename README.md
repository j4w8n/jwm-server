# jwm-server

A JSON web messaging experiment. In early development.


"jwm-server" (first-draft name) hopes to replace some email communications, like newsletters and advertisements (ex, the latest store sales).

## Why?

- Email is spammy AF
- Legit email ends up in spam/junk folders, causing senders and receivers more work.
- Email delivery is unreliable. Which stems from all of the spam, and servers trying to weed it out.
- Email "presentation" is limited. For example, when you look at a list of emails you essentially see a subject, who it's from, and maybe a couple of lines of body text.


## Benefits

- Only receive messages from those you've subscribed to (followed??). aka, no spam! An option of receiving unsolicited messages/emails, in a different folder, will be considered.
- Because of a more modern system, your message list can also show an avatar of who it's from. Being able to attach a header image to the message will display that image in the message list (think of social media feeds that have an image as part of the post). This gives content creators better ways of grabbing your attention, and receivers a richer experience.
- Use whatever jwm-server service, and client, you like. Note: when switching providers, your domain name will change; and you aren't guaranteed the same user. (P.S. usernames will be in email format - ex, sly@example.com)
